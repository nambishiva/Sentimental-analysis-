# Sentimental-analysis
Overview
This repository contains code for sentiment analysis using natural language processing techniques. Sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a piece of text.

Features
Utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sentiment classification.
Preprocessing techniques including tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal to enhance model performance.
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model effectiveness.
Support for various datasets including IMDB movie reviews, Twitter data, and customer reviews.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow / PyTorch (for RNN models)
